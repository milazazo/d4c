## About
Website for [*Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap*](https://tgaacrimezine.carrd.co/), a DGS crime-themed zine. Planned to be complete in August.

I'm not the organizer of the zine itself, just setting up the site. If you want to edit it, please message me so that I can add you as a collaborator to the repository. 

## To-do
- [ ] Update colors to match zine interior (whenever formatting is done)
- [ ] Update contributor list to use spreadsheet arrays
- [ ] Upload contributor images
- [ ] Make mobile-friendly (and desktop-friendly at smaller screen size)
- [ ] Change domain name
